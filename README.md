# Micro Apps with Web Components and Angular Elements

This example consists of three Angular projects that demonstrate how to use Web Components/ Angular Elements to implement a shell that loads micro apps:

- **shell (/src):** Shell loading micro apps
- **client-a (/projects/client-a)**: Demo micro app
- **client-b (/projects/client-b)**: Another demo micro app

## Install Dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Everything together

For using everything together, you have to build the example and run it:

```
npm run shell
npm run client-a
npm run client-b
```

in browser:
```
http://localhost:8200
```

# Open issues?

## Debugging

In "serve" mode, how can I include js.map

## JWT

How to create a securityContext in web component to use the JWT without manual handover

Will the cookie be used in PA environment?

How to deal with that on localhost? static JWT? (on FTZ/DEV expired JWTs are ok)
